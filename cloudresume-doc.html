                    <h4><strong>Building the Static Frontend</strong></h4>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Website Development</strong>
                                <p>
                                    With no prior experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or frontend development, 
                                    I first dedicated time to learning the fundamentals. 
                                    After gaining a basic understanding, 
                                    and although I was not yet confident in building a website entirely from scratch, 
                                    I explored portfolio templates on ThemeWagon and customized one to match my content and personal style.
                                </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Hosting the Static Website on Amazon S3</strong>
                                <p>
                                    This part was exciting because it marked the moment I finally began using the cloud in 
                                    a practical way. To host my static website on AWS, I took the following steps:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Created an S3 bucket with a selected bucket name and AWS Region to store all website files.</li>
                                        <li>Blocked all public access to ensure the bucket remained secure.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Instead of enabling S3 static website hosting, 
                                            CloudFront was used as the content delivery layer to improve security, performance, and provide HTTPS support.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                    
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <strong>Setting up Content Delivery Network (CDN) using Amazon CloudFront</strong>
                                <p>
                                    I set up a <strong>CloudFront distribution</strong> to deliver my website content globally, ensuring it 
                                    is served from edge locations with minimal latency. I configured the distribution's 
                                    viewer protocol policy to HTTPS only for secure connections. Since my S3 bucket has all 
                                    public access blocked, I used <strong>Origin Access Control (OAC)</strong> to restrict access so that only 
                                    CloudFront can retrieve the content, following AWS best practices.
                                </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Setting the Domain Name System (DNS) using Hostinger</strong>
                                <p>
                                    After creating the CloudFront distribution, AWS provided a default domain name, but I 
                                    opted to use a custom domain to create a professional and memorable URL. While AWS offers 
                                    Route 53 as its DNS service, I chose <strong>Hostinger</strong> for managing 
                                    <strong>alfredcm.cloud</strong> because it offered a more cost-effective solution. On 
                                    Hostinger, I configured the DNS records, including <strong>CAA</strong>, 
                                    <strong>CNAME</strong>, and <strong>ALIAS</strong>, to correctly point to my AWS resources.
                                </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Requesting an SSL/TLS Certificate in Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)</strong>
                                <p>
                                    To add an alternate domain name to my CloudFront distribution, I first requested a 
                                    public certificate from ACM in the <strong>us-east-1</strong> region. I included a 
                                    wildcard (*) in the fully qualified domain name so the certificate could cover future 
                                    subdomains like <strong>blog.alfredcm.cloud</strong> or 
                                    <strong>app.alfredcm.cloud</strong>. ACM provided a unique CNAME record for validation, 
                                    which I added to my DNS provider (Hostinger). Once ACM detected the matching CNAME, it 
                                    verified my domain ownership and issued the SSL/TLS certificate for CloudFront.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        After working through all these steps in this stage, I was excited to see my first website 
                        officially hosted in the cloud.

                    <h4><strong>Building the Serverless Backend</strong></h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Adding a DynamoDB Table to Store the Visitor Count</strong>
                                <p>
                                    To store and update the number of visitors to my website, I provisioned a DynamoDB table 
                                    to serve as the backend database for the counter. I configured it with a single partition 
                                    key and added an initial item representing the visitor count, starting at zero.
                                </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Lambda Function for Visitor Counter</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Instead of accessing DynamoDB directly from the frontend, I created a <strong>Python Lambda function</strong> 
                                    using the <code>boto3</code> library. The function retrieves the current count, increments it, 
                                    updates the database, and returns the new value to the frontend.
                                </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Security & Permissions (IAM)</strong>
                                <p>
                                    I configured a specific <strong>IAM Execution Role</strong>. Since Lambda functions are isolated 
                                    by default, I attached a policy granting the function explicit permissions to read and write 
                                    to my specific DynamoDB table, ensuring secure interactions.
                                </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Testing</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Before integrating with the frontend, I validated the function's logic using the 
                                    <strong>AWS Console Test Event</strong> feature. I confirmed success by invoking the function 
                                    and physically verifying in the DynamoDB console that the item count incremented from 0 to 1.
                                </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        To tackle this stage, I had to take on the challenge of learning Python from scratch, as I had 
                        no prior experience with the language. I dedicated time to studying the basics, but with only 
                        foundational knowledge, I was not yet able to write the code independently. By leveraging online 
                        resources and going through a process of trial and error, I was eventually able to successfully 
                        develop the Python code needed for the Lambda function.

                    <h4><strong>Frontend / Backend Integration</strong></h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>API Exposure (Lambda Function URL)</strong>
                                <p>
                                    To expose the backend logic to the public internet, I utilized the <strong>Lambda Function URL</strong> feature. 
                                    I configured the Function URL to provide a dedicated HTTPS endpoint that is directly mapped 
                                    to the Lambda function.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To ensure security at the browser level, I enabled <strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</strong> 
                                    in the Function URL settings. In the <strong>Allow Origins</strong> field, I specified my website's full domain, 
                                    <a href="https://resume.alfredcm.cloud" target="_blank">https://resume.alfredcm.cloud</a>, 
                                    so that only requests originating from my site are permitted.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This setup ensures that while the endpoint is publicly accessible, it can only be successfully invoked by 
                                    browsers running my specific website, effectively preventing unauthorized sites from inflating the visitor counter.

                            <p>
                                I wrote a code wherein, when a visitor loads the website, the static JavaScript file executes an asynchronous 
                                HTTP request to the Lambda Function URL in order to retrieve and update the current visitor count. The response 
                                is then processed and dynamically displayed on the webpage, allowing real-time interaction between the frontend 
                                and the serverless backend.
                            </p>

                            To ensure the project is maintainable and scalable, I implemented a full Continuous Integration 
                            and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. I used <strong>GitHub</strong> for version control and <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> 
                            to automate the deployment of both frontend website and the backend infrastructure. You can explore

                                    I utilized a standard branching workflow. Code is developed and tested on a feature branch before 
                                    being merged into the main branch.

                                <p>
                                    I configured a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment of my static website. This ensures 
                                    that every time I update my resume text or styling, the live site updates automatically.

                                                <strong>Development</strong> - I make changes to the website code on my local directory.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <strong>Push</strong> - I commit these changes and push them to the branch named <code>update</code>.

                                <p>
                                    I strictly avoided hardcoding the AWS credentials in the repository. Instead, I used GitHub Actions Secrets 
                                    to inject credentials into the pipeline environment only during runtime.
                                </p>
                        </li>

                    <h4><strong>Implementing Infrastructure as Code</strong></h4>

                    <p>
                        I used <strong>Terraform</strong> to automate the backend infrastructure, ensuring consistent, 
                        repeatable, and version-controlled cloud deployments. Terraform was specifically applied to 
                        provision and manage AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM roles and policies, and the Lambda Function URL 
                        for the page view counter API.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A dedicated <code>provider.tf</code> file was configured to define the AWS region and credentials, 
                        allowing Terraform to authenticate with my AWS account and align with the existing S3 bucket used for the frontend. 
                        While the frontend resources were deployed through a separate CI/CD pipeline, Terraform ensured that all backend services 
                        were reliably created, updated, and destroyed using code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This approach reduces manual configuration, minimizes deployment errors, and enforces security best practices such as 
                        least-privilege IAM roles and restricted DynamoDB access.

                    <h4><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h4>

                        <p>
                            Working on this project has been one of the most rewarding learning experiences I’ve had so far. 
                            When I started, I had little to no experience with the technical skills and cloud technologies involved. 
                            It felt overwhelming at first since there was so much to learn just to get a single piece working.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But tackling the project step by step pushed me to stay curious, keep adapting, and embrace failures as part of the process. 
                            Along the way, I learned patience, perseverance, and the value of continuously improving myself. Completing this challenge 
                            made me realize that I still have a long way to go, but it also reminded me of how far I’ve already come.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I hope this encourages others to try the Cloud Resume Challenge and start their own journey into the cloud. 
                            Thank you for taking the time to read!
